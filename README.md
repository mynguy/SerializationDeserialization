# Serialization and Deserialization

README: Serialization and Deserialization in Java

Serialization and deserialization with the Movie.java file. Serialization refers to the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be stored in a file or transferred over a network. Deserialization is the opposite process, where a byte stream is converted back into an object.

The Movie.java file contains a class that represents a movie, with instance variables for name, release year, and genre. The code includes a method called deserialize(), which takes a filename as an argument and returns a Movie object.

To use the deserialize() method, you need to have a CSV file with the movie information stored in it. The first line of the file should contain the headers for the fields, and the second line should contain the values for a single movie. The fields should be separated by commas.

When calling the deserialize() method, pass the filename of the CSV file as the argument. The method will read the file, parse the data, and create a Movie object with the information from the file.

Serialization and deserialization can be useful for storing and transferring data in a compact and efficient format. By using byte streams, you can easily store and share data without having to worry about the underlying format or encoding. With the Movie.java file, you can easily serialize and deserialize movie data to and from CSV files.
